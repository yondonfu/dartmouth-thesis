\section{Conclusion}

Cryptocurrencies and blockchains provide the foundation for systems powered by
self-organizing and self-coordinating networks of economically incentivized
individuals. We built the OpenCollab-CLI command line tool and the OpenCollab
protocol to leverage these building blocks with the goal of designing a
sustainable open source software system that aligns the incentives of all
parties involved. Ethereum provided a base blockchain layer such that we could take advantage of
its underlying trust properties and infrastructure. Consequently, we focused on
writing smart contract code that defines rules that incentivize open source
software project community members to collaborate in improving project quality
and sustainability.

We hope that at the very least the contributions of this thesis can push the
discussion around open source software sustainability forward and encourage
other open source software community members to experiment with new
approaches of maintaining healthy and supported open source software projects. The
world stands to benefit tremendously if any of these experiments are successful.
