\subsection{Ethereum}

Although security focused members of the computer science community have
expressed a fair amount of concern about the viability of Ethereum as a
blockchain used for smart contracts due to the large attack surface presented by
its Turing complete programming language, the stark reality is that the Ethereum
developer ecosystem is the most active of any other blockchain ecosystem.
Furthermore, various members of the community are actively researching methods
to better secure the Ethereum network including formal verification,
proof-of-stake as an alternative consensus algorithm to proof-of-work and smart
contract programming languages with stronger security guarantees.
Consequently, with these points in mind we decided to build the OpenCollab protocol on Ethereum.
